# Mockify Chrome Browser Extension
Mocking Spongebob Case browser extension

# How To Install
Available through the Chrome Web Store. Currently in approval stage. Will add the link as soon as it is fully published.

Other option (e.g. for development) is to add it as a local extension. Read https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest for further details.
It's basically going to "chrome://extensions", switching on "developer mode", and finally hitting "load unpacked". Just choose the very root (featuring the manifest file) of this repo.
